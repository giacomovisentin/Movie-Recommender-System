# Movie-Recommender-System
The work of creating the neural network was carried out as my undergraduate thesis at the University of Padua and was continued as a project for the Deep Learning course I took during my exchange at the University of California, San Diego.

This project is about the usage of neural networks in constructing a collaborative filtering movie recommender system using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow. The experiment uses the MovieLens database, which includes over 100,000 ratings from 600 people. The goal is to create a neural network architecture that predicts the ratings of unrated movies and provides users with a top-ten movie suggestion list. After creating the deep learning model, its performance is compared with that obtained from a recommender system based on a more traditional algorithm namely Matrix factorization to test the potential of neural networks.
