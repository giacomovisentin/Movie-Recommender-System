# Movie-Recommender-System
This project explores neural networks for a collaborative filtering movie recommender system using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow, based on the MovieLens database. It aims to predict ratings for unrated movies and generate a top-ten recommendation list. The model's performance are compared with a traditional matrix factorization algorithm model.
