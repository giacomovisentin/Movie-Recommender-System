# Movie-Recommender-System
This project is about the usage of neural networks in constructing a collaborative filtering movie recommender system using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow. The experiment uses the MovieLens database, which includes over 100,000 ratings from 600 people. The goal is to create a neural network architecture that predicts the ratings of unrated movies and provides users with a top-ten movie suggestion list. After creating the deep learning model, its performance is compared with that obtained from a recommender system based on a more traditional algorithm namely Matrix factorization to test the potential of neural networks.
